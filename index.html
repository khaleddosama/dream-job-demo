      <h2>My dream job is a web developer</h2>
      <h3>But first, what is web development ?</h3>
      <p class="web">
        Imagine you're building a house on the internet — this house is called a
        website! A web developer is like a builder who makes that house so
        people can visit it online! 🏠💻 🧱 A website has 3 main parts: 1. HTML
        – The Structure of the House 🧱 HTML is like building the walls,
        windows, and doors. It creates the basic shape of the webpage. 2. CSS –
        The Decorations and Colors 🎨 CSS makes the website look pretty. It
        changes the colors, fonts, sizes, and layout. 3. JavaScript – The Magic
        That Makes It Move ✨ JavaScript makes things work and move. It lets
        buttons do something, images move, and games work! 🎮 Example: Let’s say
        you want to make a website about your favorite game: HTML writes the
        title: “My favorite game is Minecraft” CSS makes the title green and big
        JavaScript makes the picture dance when you click it!
